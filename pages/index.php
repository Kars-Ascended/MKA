        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>- Where are the songs?</h3>
        <p>Currently i use a free host that has a file limit of ~2Gb, so as of now the songs cannot be hosted on here. if this does not change in the future i will find alternate hosting solutions to get the music on here.</p>

        <h3>- What else do you plan to archive?</h3>
        <p>Everything. his music, social posts, all images/videos, live shows, snippets shown, whatever we can find. the real hard part is figuring out how to store them and also figuring out how to display them.</p>

        <h3>- "I found a problem / something incorrect on the site"</h3>
