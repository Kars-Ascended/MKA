        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>- Where are the songs?</h3>
        <p>Currently i use a free host that has a file limit of ~2Gb, so as of now the songs cannot be hosted on here. if this does not change in the future i will find alternate hosting solutions to get the music on here.</p>

        <h3>- What else do you plan to archive?</h3>
        <p>Everything. his music, social posts, all images/videos, live shows, snippets shown, whatever we can find. the real hard part is figuring out how to store them and also figuring out how to display them.</p>

        <h3>- I found a problem / something incorrect on the site</h3>
        <p>Let me know in the discord or subreddit linked below.</p>

        <h3>- Why does it take forever to load songs?</h3>
        <p>Make sure 'Song' is unchecked while filtering/loading, because of the sheer amount of songs it causes some lag trying to find/load the element</p>

        <br>

        <h3>A few songs might be missing from the database, if you find them please let me know</h3>
